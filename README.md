### <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/> Hey there!

I’m [**AVG**](https://basicallyavg.dev), a fullstack developer based in the US! I like building clean, minimalistic apps, primarily with Kotlin or Typescript. I only have a few repositories open to the public at the moment.

**These days I’m focused on:**
- Javascript, Python, and Kotlin!
- Small, minimalistic apps.
- Designing (commisioning) websites for other people!

**Some stuff I built:**
- [YAGL](https://github.com/averagecryptonerd/YAGL) -  An open-source Android launcher designed as a flexible alternative to popular options like Nova and Niagra.
- [basicallyavg.dev](https://basicallyavg.dev) -  My personal portfolio created in HTML! I really need to update it..
